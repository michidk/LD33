## A game made for Ludum Dare 33 (compo)


The theme of the game-jam was "You are the monster".
I made this game in 24 hours working solo and made all the assets myself. 
I used the Unity Engine (ver 5.1.2f1), its written in C# using Visual Studio and Resharper. 
The only external libary i used, was the editor plugin Visual Studio Tools 2015 for Unity. 
You can remove it without breaking the game.

I know the code is not very clean and efficient, but i only had like 24 hours because i travled to Rome, next day.


Controls: 
Mouse & Keyboard:
W, A, S, D or arrow keys to move. Aim with the mouse. Left click to shoot.

Controller:
left stick walk. right stick aim. LB, RB, LT, RT, A to shoot.

There is more in this game than you think.
There a two endings (you can continue the game after these).
TIP: 
- killed a ton of slimes? look at the score.
- The theme fits very well.

Have fun!
