## A game made for Ludum Dare 33 (compo)

The theme of the game-jam was "You are the monster".
I made this game in 26 hours working solo and made all the assets myself. I used the Unity Engine (ver 5.1.2f1), its written in C# using Visual Studio and Resharper. The only external libary i used, was the editor plugin Visual Studio Tools 2015 for Unity. You can remove it without breaking the game.
